    - name: SUCHAI 1
      status: Active (Integrated into P-POD in Netherlands waiting to be carried on to USA for final integration in a Spacex's Falcon 9 rocket)
      description: Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation. SUCHAI is the first chilean CubeSat developed by undergraduate students, engineers and professors of the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments at Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile. It has three main goals (1) Generate avanced human resources, (2) Create space technology in our country and (3) serve as a vehicle to carry scientific experiments to space.

    - name: Langmuir probe
      status: Active (Design phase)
      description: Payload for SUCHAI 2 and 3 that will measure the plasma of the ionosphere. This sensor is the most common sensor for plasma diagnostics in space and laboratory. This sensor consists in an electrode with a fixed or varying potential able to determine in-situ the ionospheric plasma characteristics. The current measured by the probe is ploted in a current-voltage (IV) curve, allowing determine electron and ion densities, and electron temperatures.
